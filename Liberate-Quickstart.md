# Liberate-Quickstart
If you are looking for an easy way to convert your systems from EL clones, Like CentOS 7 or even RHEL 9, to SUSE Liberty Linux you are looking at the right Document

The method to do so that we are using here is based on [Uyuni](https://www.uyuni-project.org/) / [SUSE Manager](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/), which is a tool for system management, patching deployment and automation.
